# JLSS - Jeet Laxman Sitaram Solanki

## Personality
Rethink and rebuild systems from scratch. I redesign architectures and will soon forge my own for deep learning and machine intelligence.  
I build machine intelligence from self-observation seeing present by making it future and then optimize.

## My Organization: Because I like Separation of Concern
_I use GitHub organizations to separate concerns and manage projects with clarity and modularity._
