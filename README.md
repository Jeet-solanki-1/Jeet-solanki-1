# JLSS - Jeet Laxman Sitaram Solanki

## Personality
Rethink and rebuild systems from scratch. I redesign architectures and will soon forge my own for deep learning and machine intelligence.  
I build machine intelligence from self-observation seeing present by making it future and then optimize.

## My Organizations: Because I like Separation of Concern
_I use GitHub organizations to separate concerns and manage projects with clarity and modularity._

### Portfolio: [jeet-solanki-portfolio.netlify.app](https://jeet-solanki-portfolio.netlify.app)
_I started my journey by changing the color of a webpage using just HTML and CSS.  
I didn‚Äôt sleep for over 7 days ‚Äî shocked by the magic I had just discovered.  
Coming from a small town with almost no exposure to computers, it felt like I had touched the future._
